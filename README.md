<i>Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.</i>

  The Corner Grocer program is for project 3 of SNHU's CS 210 course. It is to showcase communication between C++ and Python.

<i>What did you do particularly well?</i>

  I feel that I handled the menu and validated user input well.

<i>Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?</i>

  While this satisfies the requirements of the project, I would not solve a problem like this with passing parameters back and forth between two programming languages. Python did the heavy lifting with the list manipulation, so I would probably have done the whole thing in Python. I feel this would have been a lot simpler.

<i>Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?</i>

  I especially had difficulty passing a string parameter from C++ to Python. I searched the internet for solutions and eventually pieced together what I needed.

<i>What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or coursework?</i>

  Being able to use two programming languages together seems useful.

<i>How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?</i>

  I commented what I felt would be necessary to understand this later, should I revisit it.
