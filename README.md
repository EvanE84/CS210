Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  The Corner Grocer program is for project 3 of SNHU's CS 210 course. It is to showcase communication between C++ and Python.

What did you do particularly well?
  I feel that I handled the menu and validating user input well.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  While this satisfies the requirements of the project, I would not solve a problem like this with passing parameters back and forth between two programming languages. Python did the heavy lifting with the list manipulation, so I would probably have done the whole thing in Python. I feel this would have been a lot simplier.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
  I especially had difficulty passing a string parameter from C++ to Python. I searched the internet for solutions and eventually pieced together what I needed.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
  Being able to use two programmming languages together seems useful.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  I commented what I felt would be necessary to understand this later, should I revisit it.
